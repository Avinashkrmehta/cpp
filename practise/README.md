Happy Valentine’s Day Program in C



Here’s a detailed guide on **important pattern programs to practice**:

---

## **1. Basic Star Patterns**

These are foundational, good for practicing nested loops.

**Examples:**

1. **Right-angled triangle**

```
*
**
***
****
```

2. **Inverted right-angled triangle**

```
****
***
**
*
```

3. **Equilateral triangle / Pyramid**

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

4. **Inverted Pyramid**

```
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

**Focus:** Loop control, spaces vs stars, row-wise logic.

---

## **2. Number Patterns**

Patterns using numbers instead of stars:

**Examples:**

1. **Right-angled number triangle**

```
1
12
123
1234
```

2. **Inverted number triangle**

```
1234
123
12
1
```

3. **Floyd’s triangle**

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```

4. **Pascal’s triangle**

```
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
```

**Focus:** Incremental counters, combinations for Pascal’s triangle.

---

## **3. Pyramid & Diamond Patterns**

* **Pyramid of stars** (center aligned)
* **Diamond pattern**

```
   *
  ***
 *****
  ***
   *
```

* **Hollow pyramid / diamond**

```
   *
  * *
 *   *
*******
```

**Focus:** Combination of spaces and stars, conditional printing for hollow shapes.

---

## **4. Advanced / Mixed Patterns**

* **Hourglass patterns**
* **Number palindromes**

```
   1
  121
 12321
1234321
```

* **Zigzag or wave patterns** (for loops + modulus tricks)
* **Alphabet patterns**

```
A
A B
A B C
```

---

## **5. Tips for Practicing Pattern Programs**

1. **Break into parts:** Often a pattern is “spaces + stars/numbers” per row. Handle each separately.
2. **Nested loops mastery:** Most patterns require outer loop for rows, inner loops for content.
3. **Conditional logic:** Hollow or complex patterns require `if` statements inside loops.
4. **Try variations:** Once you can print a pattern with `*`, try it with numbers, letters, or different alignments.

✅ There you go! All **35 patterns** drawn in ASCII.

If you want, I can also **provide ready-to-run C code** for all 35 patterns so you can generate them directly in a program.

Do you want me to do that next?


If your goal is to prepare for **FAANG-level product-based companies**, the focus should be on **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving patterns** rather than isolated questions. Practicing the right **problem patterns** helps you tackle unfamiliar questions efficiently. Here’s a structured breakdown:

---

## **1. Array & String Patterns**

Arrays and strings are foundational. Patterns to practice:

1. **Two-pointer techniques**

   * Problems: Pair sum, triplet sum, Dutch National Flag, container with most water.
2. **Sliding window**

   * Problems: Maximum sum subarray, longest substring without repeating characters, minimum window substring.
3. **Prefix/Suffix sums**

   * Problems: Subarray sum equals K, range sum queries.
4. **Cyclic arrays**

   * Problems: Rotate array, circular subarray sum.

**Tips:** Focus on transforming brute-force O(n²) solutions to O(n) with sliding window or two pointers.

---

## **2. Hashing & Frequency Counting**

Hash maps reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n):

* Count frequencies, detect duplicates.
* Subarray sum problems using prefix sums + hash map.
* Two-sum and its variations.
* Anagram checks, group words, or strings.

**Pattern:** Map key = property, value = index/count.

---

## **3. Linked List Patterns**

Linked lists are tricky for interviews:

* **Slow & Fast pointers (Floyd’s cycle detection)**

  * Detect cycle, find start of cycle, middle of list.
* **Reversing Linked List**

  * Reverse entire list, reverse k-group, palindrome linked list.
* **Merge / Split**

  * Merge two sorted lists, reorder list.

---

## **4. Stack & Queue Patterns**

Classic for “next greater/smaller” or “expression evaluation”:

* Monotonic stack (Next Greater Element, Largest Rectangle in Histogram)
* Sliding window maximum (deque)
* Valid parentheses and expression evaluation (stack)

---

## **5. Recursion & Backtracking**

FAANG interviews love recursion and backtracking:

* Subsets, permutations, combinations.
* N-Queens, Sudoku Solver.
* Word search, maze/graph traversal.
* Pattern: Choose/Not Choose or Explore/Backtrack.

---

## **6. Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree Patterns**

Trees are extremely common:

* **DFS & BFS Traversals**

  * Inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order.
* **Height, diameter, balance check**
* **Lowest Common Ancestor**
* **Binary Search Tree (BST) properties**

  * Insert, delete, search, validate BST.
* **Tree dynamic programming / recursion**

  * Max path sum, sum of subtree, diameter of tree.

**Pattern:** Recursive DFS with return values to accumulate information.

---

## **7. Graph Patterns**

Graphs test both algorithms and problem-solving thinking:

* BFS / DFS
* Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
* Connected components, cycles, topological sort
* Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
* Graph coloring / bipartite check

**Pattern:** Explore all neighbors → recursive DFS / iterative BFS → track visited.

---

## **8. Dynamic Programming Patterns**

DP is often tricky but can be broken into patterns:

* **1D DP (array problems)**

  * Fibonacci, climbing stairs, max subarray sum, coin change.
* **2D DP (matrix problems)**

  * Unique paths, min path sum, edit distance.
* **Subsequence/Subarray**

  * Longest increasing subsequence, longest common subsequence.
* **Knapsack type**

  * 0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack.

**Pattern:** Identify state → recursive relation → optimize with memoization or tabulation.

---

## **9. Greedy & Interval Problems**

* Interval scheduling, meeting rooms, merge intervals.
* Fractional knapsack.
* Huffman coding concept.

**Pattern:** Sort → pick optimal based on problem constraints.

---

## **10. Binary Search / Divide & Conquer**

* Binary search on index, answer, or search space.
* Search in rotated array.
* Matrix search (row-wise & column-wise sorted)
* Merge sort, quicksort, search in sorted matrix.

---

## **Additional Notes**

* **Time & Space Complexity:** Always aim to optimize your initial brute-force solution. FAANG loves O(n log n) or O(n) solutions when applicable.
* **Practice Platforms:** LeetCode (especially Medium/Hard), InterviewBit, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks.
* **System Design & Object-Oriented Design:** For senior roles, but first focus on DS & algorithms.
